Poem: "|I Know Now That When I Die I Shall Proclaim My Love" 

The first line of the poem when translated means, "Please forget me."
This one is not unique among poems in that long after they've been published|,|
particularly those that deal with death, a profound respect tends to be given
to the sentiments behind them.| Moreover, the experiences that we receive
distant death — including the lives we've shared with others and the things
tangible we've left behind — I truly believe are so important, even transcend|ent;
neither of which the poet could have known.| That they could landfill their ego
by beautifying a brief walking metaphor into a verse of hope is puzzling.
(Well, strange and insane, actually.) Do they not appreciate its message,|
or simply like all poets is their content restricted to the language of the ego?
