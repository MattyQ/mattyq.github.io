Poem: "|Harvest Of Songs"

Whether I survive the winter, sharp and haggard, fresh and bountiful,
looking in odd directionsâ€”I am shunned by cities that exert their will|
on those who are here alone on certain holidays. Bread and valerian
from the September into the October harvest clatter passed off my tongue.
Murky and stale as soup|, with a spray of sherry. Henceforth you grow beards, I
shiver at the strings of memories that hope to rewind into the evening of a
stick of inc|ense, cashmere blanket, and online dreams. From now on you grew the corn,
the pinecone, the bayberry, tortured sweet or fallen light. The dust that flies|
free fell on your face and she dyes your pallor.
