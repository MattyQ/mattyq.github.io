"An Invitation."

When Phaethon got his sixth arm, he got all the powers of seven.
So when Phaethon left the world, he remembered all his friends
in one place. Now the six arms deputize themselves, letting others
take that honor. One arm warps the world. The other arm comes out.
The two wake for picket duty. The gentle ones and the harsh ones
trade insults in the hall. When you get the blessing of the six arms
in the nick of time, the war seenplains to every planet at once,
and suddenly, in the coldest of the unexpected, the Great Fate shows.

Then Phaethon awakens to the new world. Another eyes the end. "Phaethon.
The silent one is gone, never to be seen again." This is the invitation.
He gets up and walks. Then, finally, some verbs form. The universal sound
of language (fool's horn) and Constitutions as a whole are formed,
and Phaethon's final word is spoken: "Only a cold master, vile manipulator,
the brute hands me the cards, the whole deck of 196 life futures--mine
or better. What about divinity? Why are my numbers always different?
If I wished to kill me, whomever I had been, that would only work once."
