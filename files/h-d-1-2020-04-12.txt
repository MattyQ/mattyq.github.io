Poem: "Evening"

The light passes
from ridge to ridge,
from flower to flower—
the hepaticas, wide-spread
under the light
grow faint—
the petals reach inward,
the blue tips bend
toward the bluer heart
and the flowers are lost.

The cornel-buds are still white,
but shadows dart
from the cornel-roots—
black creeps from root to root,
each leaf
cuts another leaf on the grass,
shadow seeks shadow,
then both leaf
and leaf-shadow are lost.


Poem: "Helen"

All Greece hates   
the still eyes in the white face,   
the lustre as of olives   
where she stands,   
and the white hands.   

All Greece reviles   
the wan face when she smiles,   
hating it deeper still   
when it grows wan and white,   
remembering past enchantments   
and past ills.   

Greece sees unmoved,   
God’s daughter, born of love,   
the beauty of cool feet   
and slenderest knees,   
could love indeed the maid,   
only if she were laid,   
white ash amid funereal cypresses.


Poem: "Oread"

Whirl up, sea—
whirl your pointed pines,
splash your great pines
on our rocks,
hurl your green over us,
cover us with your pools of fir.


Poem: "|Leini"


O Gods, sleepless and dying,

pray for us to speak,

instead of our dying shrill

crying, if we could still speak|.


Poem: "Woman at Fishing Village"

Holy widow compared to blacksmith,

with blue eyes for Katherina's glass.


Poem: "The| Stoat."

Within the smouldering reefs

she had joined the roving ships:

gold rings hanging on the neck,

whispering of the spindle wh|irls.


Poem: "Popocationia"


In the Domos and the Sinai

The beauties pay homage, threatening marriage

with the Cretans,| her brother.


Poem: "Virgil's Pain"

One goddess, who but her own eye

bore pity and love, to all parts behind:

|
well-mounted and towering, rather than fire,

appointed with golden rings,

tis all-conquering, after a conflict,

undaunted, and so is all| her billowing cloak.


Poem: "Leines Aphos I. 859 Conrad Daniele"

Eclectic wanderer, wandering on affairs,

the rare beauty| the younger.


Poem: "A Europaeum by Charisius Erasmus"

The Flea that talked little, all delighted with the winner;

not| fishing pleased for the Esquars;

but most sprang to pleasure in touching and touching

the love-wanderers at pouncing.
