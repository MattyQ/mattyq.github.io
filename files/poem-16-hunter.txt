Poem: "Hunter"

In all longer lives, when the day ends and the night starts,
you never know when in their busy lives they lost sense. To
them the shadows are stray| dogs and scorpions. I do not mind shadows.
They are a gift, the slow sleep that soaks in a corner of a street,|
cast against the glow of a thousand interval candles.
They come single and drawn at dawn after wards. Raw flesh, crude jaws, eyes
frontal, dark lashes, and white artificial bite,| bones like talons. Low
mouths crush weeping grass. They are a menace, like flames.
They are inheritors of the wild, captivated by pet|-eyes and daisy
eyes lined with grey. Like night, like lens-drifts, security deflection,
disconfirming. The shadows come along you and beg, and| call and scream.
