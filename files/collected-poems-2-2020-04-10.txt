Poem: "The Golden Notebook"

Here's that notebook
reeking like liquor from the hand
of its owner,
of men who don't care.

Oh, no, when they say you need
to get angrier,
they mean you need to become emaciated
lawyers who don't give a damn.


Poem: "Bitter Gradient"

This is a cockeyed novel,
it contains both bitter and positive
variations.
It can be enjoyed again as can

all the others,
but it is someone else who should say: "
THIS'S A DEPRAVITY.
NOW GO AWAY," the one

who said, "
THERE IS NEED.
Repetition will grease
another version of the same basic story,

and before long there
will be naught left but a muse, nothing more
but a genetic clog.
And because of that, I pity whoever lives in it."


Poem: "Not All This is New"

One is never safe.
At the outset the reader begs anxious questions.
Then one is bent over the unsteady floor
and left with the leech-like feeling that nothing is what it seems.
One scrabbles through the dark scum
of the ceiling without answer.
Although everything might start out succumbing,
the dream unravels in our faces before we can quite breathe
before we can exhale without impact.


Poem: "The Fine Print: The Awe of Indecision"

So now I'm here.
When the Devil wants to judge.
I just return to smokey dreams or mine.
I hate to hear the questions again.

You are wrong lizard.
You remember nothing.
You are young one.
You are wiser: quiet in the big dreams, late to be a
consumer.

It's bad to lie,
being a — like before — lizards tells me America is full.
They're not ready yet, their gusting stomachs forcing their patience.
The stops that can feel so functional are so accommodating.
So I need the roads. The even finishes waiting for their plans.
Such boxes, filled with black rubber and plastic.
But I don't look at them. I do not need them.
I still cannot drop my curiosity.
But under fire.
In the terrible aftermath of a knowledge
that says, "I am so great."
