Poem: "Asleep on the Streets" 

Another night we lie on the streets like children,
neither ourselves nor our friends. We just sit
in the cold sun watching the city that never sleeps.
When the tip of each aluminum leek makes its sound,
a minstrel's lines send their accordion tunes down
the Princes Highway on locks of red hair. Like a chill
wind and sky of winter, directly south and west.
Spinning of ice there where the multitudes don't stay.
There they must sleep beside a living sea or die
by starvation. A sole bridge runs across a frozen river
that flows from Lake Michigan to the Chesapeake Bay.
And voices once beautiful, the voices of the King
and the Queen. Now the mists and fog have passed.
The waters darken and press in when the moon rises.
That crowd we call the obscurity. We have neither stars
nor seas. And now on a sweltering day as in a cold tomb,
the applause lives yet, glistening like jewels. We are
being made to wonder as if on a witch fair â€“ over
the rock of civilization that lies below. Forever in it,
still hidden in its branches. In the darkness, perhaps they
always will be a thousand days silent, as the grave is kelp.
