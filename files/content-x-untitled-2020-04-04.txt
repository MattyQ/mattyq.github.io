Gypteetoo is a comedian working on a new sketch. The name of the sketch is, "|The Cowardly Cows." Plot: A cow has decked out his barn, which is similar to Digest's old Barn, with roosters, bunnies and unicorns. In| the prow of the berry tosser is a young cow who wears a balloon crown; he steals some apples from the stalls. He sends them flying into multiple cows' faces and then swallows one|; at the club police arrive, scream their heads off, and manage to dispel the balloons. The head of the recording studio and a tenth cow must personally go in after the young cow and find the apple. Ricardo| Montalban, Daryl Hall, Bishop Gahan, The Losers, Sunday Burquest, Dave Gahan, Billy Crystal, and a fellow cow attempt to retrieve the stolen apples.| Style- wise, it's a mashup of routines from older Barns with the vibrancy of Second City, and like Professionalines' jokes, some feel a little dated, like Joe Swan|berg's Patrick McCurley from Favors & Felines.
