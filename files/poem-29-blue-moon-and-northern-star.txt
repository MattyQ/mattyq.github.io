Poem: "|Blue Moon and Northern Star"

In many seasons and many year
things come and expenses are paid,
learning and reading finally come
and rapture and danger come,|
crossing the lake, flying through the wind and rain.
There is no journey unlike the whole journey this wayâ€”
once you by the seaside calm take care, stop where| arms embrace
and leave your winglets to take the rare cup of love,
pay not attention to strange sounds overhead
that swim through the very mouths.
