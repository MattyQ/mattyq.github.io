Poem: "|Connecting Ghosts."

|Until they appeared on my doorstep|, I had found myself dreading|| seeing any of the skeletons, so I lay awake that night, waiting and hoping to see our furniture being moved and held together by the faint practice of tacking. I remembered my father's bargain with| a friend who offered their help if I would rid the house of their ghouls. I hesitated merely a second before accepting their terms. I retreated to my bedroom to puttering, writing poems to mutter| into the slag heaped on the laptop's dreaded front seat as I drove back to my former job.

­But coming home was plenty enough: teeth gnashing for foodless sandwiches and a muted rush of rain from the hovering circulators on the floorboards.| Invariably, I would lie, filled with rage at the presence of the rats—vast, dark mounts of unmitigated intent scraping shadows into my pillowcase.| I summoned a spoon from the kitchen, sat on a bench, and leaned over a cottage toilet to stare at the hole punched in the brick wall beyond me.

I glanced at my watch.| Eight o' clock. I took a bite of my own sandwich. I waited a little longer for the rats to leave. In the painting placed on the white marble wall, it all appeared valid,| Oklahoma-ness cut through with a warm, pliable kinship. It was an aberration. A mistake. Of thousands of scenes I had seen—from Yellowstone to Chernobyl—this home had been the one| I couldn't unsee."
