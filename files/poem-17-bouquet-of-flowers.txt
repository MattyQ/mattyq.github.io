Poem: "|Bouquet Of Flowers."|

Rhubarb, warm ether, and tumbleweed. This is my bouquet of flowers.|
From the far side of the old fishpond that you like, on the shore
of another word I turn my gaze to the mirror. Enjoying the pond,
the song of the lambs, the lullaby of the gulls|, twizened with myrtle
and nasturtium, maybe dropping the twig of the eulenium right there,
cauldron drawn toward the foyer with| your fair flawless brush
not quickly chasing the round blackberries of the court.
I loaf in the comeliness of years; we live in an age of memory.
We talk into your glass of wine, try to keep our ears| open,
until the rare delirious sound of strings and the guttural laugh
of your husband makes us well again.
