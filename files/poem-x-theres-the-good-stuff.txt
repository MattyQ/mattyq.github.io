Poem: "|There's the Good Stuff"

There's the Good Stuff, the hard stuff, the long stuff,
the stuff that rocks the world but is difficult to squish.
|Bitterly hot, bitterly cold, oppressively local,
it rises like a genie in a lamp.
It's taken, it's forgotten.
Heaped, heaped, heaped,
yet empty, empty, and CRAZY.
