Poem: "Magnetic"

Dark and quiet through the cloth of heaven's cooling shadow
A gull flies. With a crinkled flap his creamy white wings prod and fly,
settling into the falling roof shadows. They fold from white to white, fade.
His coverts knock the sea-vault sky, and he iridesces with sea-echo.
From his fame in speech comes a cloud of itch in memory,
of white and gold. They say he was young. He was handsome. He was cool.
My childhood, in the New World, of all places,
I feel the beat of his heart in the long slog nightâ€”
his stare below my bedroom window with a glow of signal.
