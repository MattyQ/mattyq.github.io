Poem: "Laugh"

The fans heard his chuckle, inside and outside.|| Laughing
his way into the backstage of worlds beyond| limit.
Through all the walks in our long alley, rocking to see every face
that knows something learned in the end. Laughing through
the showers of stars,| bending on a free morning from last night's
fighting, roaring through the speeding waves of cash in small purses.
He| was looking hit or miss that last night; their faces flushed, his music
pining. But the future never sees the shut-up laughter| spurring us on,
tapping without common plan as the hero runs to reach the rest exhaled
in a| silence so intense, I saw that advancing breath like the moon.
