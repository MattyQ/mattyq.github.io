Poem: "Down The Well." 

We sleep, and you swim in lands where time has no weight,
where no sun sets. You shiver your substance through stream
and flowing-stone and wolf pastures. In the spring night air,
wrinkles signed and summer-kissed, the breath of roses,
vine-grape and carnations. Down the well, skyfire and moonlight.
You swim, and your touch is but a gasping flash. Under a granite
vault your stomach splinters. The rising river of your cheeks.
You are too far gone, setting veils of howls on the shore, 
wandering the distance of star leaves and shadow-wreaths.
