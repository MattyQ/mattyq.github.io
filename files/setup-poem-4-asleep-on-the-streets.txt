Poem: "Asleep on the Streets" 

Another night we lie on the streets like children, neither ourselves nor our friends. We just sit in the cold sun watching the city that never sleeps.|

When the tip of each aluminum leek makes its sound, a minstrel's lines send their accordion tunes down the Prince's Highway on locks of red hair.

Like a| chill wind and sky of winter, directly south and west. Spinning of ice there where the multitudes don't stay. There they must sleep beside a living sea

or to| die by starvation.

–From "Thoughts in a Dream"

Poem: "Asleep on the Streets" 

Another night we lie on the streets like children, neither ourselves nor our friends. We just sit in the cold sun watching the city that never sleeps.|

When the tip of each aluminum leek makes its sound, a minstrel's lines send their accordion tunes down the Princes Highway on locks of red hair.

Like a| chill wind and sky of winter, directly south and west. Spinning of ice there where the multitudes don't stay. There they must sleep beside a living sea

or to| die by starvation.| A sole bridge runs across a frozen river that flows from Lake Michigan to the Chesapeake Bay. And voices once beautiful,

the voices of the King and the Queen. Now the mists and fog have| passed. The waters darken and press in when the moon rises. That crowd we call the obscurity.

We have neither stars nor seas. And now on a sweltering day as in| a cold tomb, the applause lives yet, glistening like jewels. We are being made to wonder

as if on a witch fair – over the rock of civilization that lies below. Forever| in it, still hidden in its branches. In the darkness, perhaps they always will be a thousand

days silent, as the grave is kelp.
