Poem: "|Some Old Jade Bridge in a Video Game."

|Here we walked down an old tunnel.|
Upon seeing the fallen "Ancient Tree,"
the NPC in charge interceded,

saying, "We must begin by making camp here.
To increase our chances of survival
while surrounded by tanks, we| must hide here."

We hibernated beneath the ancient tree
for fifteen days. Mostly hiding from the solar
rays, underneath the legendary jade bridge.

|My companion and I read a strange book
that described the origins| of the world.
This forbidden| writing wwas sealed

into a secret place, making it all but impossible
to find. Wondering, in the hope that nothing
like this would ever happen to us, we| dug deep|

into the foundation of the beautiful jade
bridge. The illumination grew weaker
with each step. As time continued to overwhelm us,

a strange machine of inexplicable purpose|
emerged, blocked our path, stood between us
and the gaping hole. It started reassuringly,

pronouncing a strange phrase. Then it melted,
just as we thought it would. After an eternity,
we emerged below the| ancient tree bridge

and had split seconds to go deeper underground.
We tried to fight the monsters that lurked within
the pools, Â­but found that we were too far gone.
