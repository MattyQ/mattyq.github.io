Poem: "All Dead, All Dead"

She came without a farthing
A babe without a name
So much ado about nothing
Is what she'd try to say

So much ado my lover
So many games we played
Through every fleeted summer
Through every precious day

All dead, all dead
All the dreams we had
And I wonder why I still live on
All dead, all dead
And alone I'm spared
My sweeter half instead
All dead and gone
All dead

All dead, all dead
At the rainbow's end
And still I hear her own sweet song
All dead, all dead
Take me back again
You know my little friend's
All dead and gone

Her ways are always with me
I wander all the while
But please you must forgive me
I am old but still a child

All dead, all dead
But I should not grieve
In time it comes to everyone
All dead, all dead
But in hope I breathe
Of course I don't believe
You're dead and gone
All dead and gone


Poem: "Spread Your Wings"

Sammy was low
Just watching the show
Over and over again
Knew it was time
He'd made up his mind
To leave his dead life behind
His boss said to him
"Boy you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions right out of your head
Sammy who do you think that you are?
You should've been sweeping up the Emerald Bar"

Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
'Cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

He spends his evenings alone in his hotel room
Keeping his thoughts to himself, he'd be leaving soon
Wishing he was miles and miles away
Nothing in this world, nothing would make him stay

Since he was small
Had no luck at all
Nothing came easy to him
Now it was time
He'd made up his mind
"This could be my last chance"
His boss said to him, "Now listen boy!
You're always dreaming
You've got no real ambition, you won't get very far
Sammy boy, don't you know who you are?
Why can't you be happy at the Emerald Bar?"

So honey

Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
'Cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

Come on, honey

Fly with me


Poem: "|When the Bough Breaks"

When the Bough Breaks

I am storming after the dawn

I lose touch with myself daily

The years are meaningless to me|

Unless they're measured on my fingers - all broken

My life is in ruins, apart from the face, it floats by

My ears perk as my feet stumble

In| time a new world has blossomed beneath me

With all my flaws exposed it spills beyond

As I commune with lack it's easy to see

A man and his dreams are| broken

When the bough breaks

(All I can say)

Shout, shout as the world trembles again

When the bough breaks
