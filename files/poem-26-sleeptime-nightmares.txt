Poem: "Sleeptime Nightmares"

Joseph and I fell asleep sideways, where windows in| every room face out.| In the early morning we rolled over to look at sunlight falling from the patio, caught haphazardly across the painted canvas, gravel, and nightsands. We stretched, groped for lines on paper|,| picked milk out of a tumbler. We fell asleep and dreamed of lonely nights and hills and land, propelled by a steady road, petroleum, the wind.
