Poem: "Jejune Shadow Man."

Last night I| dreamed| of being an old lion, with a beard
spanning the width of my hips. Opening my eyes, I tried
to dismiss the grass.| Donkeys drove each last zebra,
and grazers cut grass. The cracked tree was actually redbrick.
The stray crag shouldn't have fit into the dried| riverbed.
It just held the sky. A scuzzcackle growing tracks of dead rain
and sand, rain-drenched flip-flops, busted boots like big cobbles|.
I felt nostalgic, and smelled changes deep in the ground.
Noise from the street. I attempted the front gate and came close,
too. On the dusty| asphalt road a shadow man drove a dune buggy.
In its mouth was a rock pick. I saw him not as a distant scene
but one I'd seen already. The| dogs had jumped his yard
and all at once I remembered the natives and the rattle-snake.
