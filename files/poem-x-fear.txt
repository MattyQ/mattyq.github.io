Poem: "Fear"

You were afraid you'd drop a letter
in the rain.| And then it turned out to be a light.
This morning, after the rain,
I blanked. Caused myself to stumble,
parents'| Christmas greetings,
alarm clock blinking, tea-naps in the teapot,
the kids playing smack in the hall.
I visited the apartment, water| stains,|
the phone from last night (you were calling).
In the evening I drove to the hospital.
Maybe you wore shoes. At least you erased me
