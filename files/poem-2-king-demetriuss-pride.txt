Poem: "King Demetrius's Pride"

"I am master, he whom gifted rivers and stars reproach not yet, but soon."
The feebler and contempter was their king, and he made them submit

as the impotent who ruled not himself, but decreed the gods moldy.
He did this only with base detestation – a coward's search for a hero

in a dark world. Demetrius had spoken fondly of Alexander's Porus, his subject
by the Hydaspes, but the fact is that Zeus gave nothing but coal to Porus,

a scattered man who had amassed a darkness in his distant home-town,
while Demetrius flamed Typhon just above the rocks – who felt

that this made him look more modern in contrast to Porus' long life of sorrow.
But both of these men had wisdom; both of them, when perish'd, behind the ruins

of their light cities, had borne a human child. And love and friendship wove
and drew them together. When their impressions of the world of that blessed time

were broken, Demetrius' final end was a ruin; Porus, conquering, like Peucestas,
attack'd his crownlet and stepped into his charmed city, where still the oldest domes

bound together a patch of bazaars, the greatest in size once the temple Olympia,
that on his conquest had risen into the heavens, and finally began to rust and ruin.
