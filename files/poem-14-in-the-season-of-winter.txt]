Poem: "In The Season Of Winter"

It's drizzyloo time, and the cackling gizzard
appears to be drawing the line at the sky.
In the face of a storm they've cowed, all us pilgrims stray mad,
while others dream of grand triumph and life's sweetest sweets.
Whitecaps blowing soap bubbles and a loud and fast ticker
cause a man with a bottle to bellow above a crowd,
his homerun dogging the rain. A lone squirrel wanders alone:
always listening for rattlers and distress, pursuing
its entertainment more for its own soul than for the payment.
And I can hear my father's smile, my grandma's speechless laughter,
the whistling of a battery -- The memory of a thousand nights
outside harbors and through streets of the region, of gifts
to treasured kin. Indebted, free, I sit and watch, a madman
in a coat of black and yellow, a pilgrim stormridden, melancholy:
seasons of winter roam, reliving and enjoying the past.
