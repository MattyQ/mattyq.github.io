Poem: "|Inspiration Song"

I am terrified of bourgeois abstraction. The grease on their pencils, the peanut butter on their aprons made up with lottery tickets.
They're not normal people| that come from normal families or hospitals like real people.
They like to chat and smoke their pipes while money compliments champions,
Coke this and Colorado that, fulfilling an art school dream.| I'm too flat for rap music.
They like to relax, whenever they're given a steamy apartment to work and eat by themselves.
They like to allow their heads to rot| in the white room. I'm scared of work.
I've loved everything I've ever written, maybe not all of it at once, but I want to like it.
I| like to dream of people and places and hopes. I love them like I am one.
