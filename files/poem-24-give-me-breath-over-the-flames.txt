Poem: |Give Me Breath Over the Flames" 

Give me breath over pastures of the exterior universe,
where authors etch the poetic value of our surroundings.|

Into heat flows wild passionsâ€”each breath captures the ocean,
its restorative truths and richness of feeling; over leagues

of open grass descend buzzing bees, thirsty ones. From the dim
realm shoreward rolls the surf that well|ed from the fever deep.

Cold winds blast away weeds. Give me breath over the flames:|
form, force, direction shaping them, giving us creation's meaning.
