Poem: "|Streams and Royalties"

Storage space, where we have been hidden from the sunlight,
behind the wheel, loaded for years. For these springs tonight,
we stand like life forms in a niche. Once, centuries ago,
D|aughters of Baldom hated the Gorgons. No railroad track
can fool me. Secret or place, beside a lake; detachment
underground, the passage of intelligence will mark
the dry year. Maybe| seasonal speech. Instead of people, magic,
mirrors and ash specks. The rats run after what they think
is trash. A voice in their heads fell silent. Steal
from a place where croak| echoes around. And turn
those scratches on your skin where we always leave you.
