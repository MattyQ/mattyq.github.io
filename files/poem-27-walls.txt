Poem: "|Walls"

But blind? Did her charms deceive you? How many turn to battle? How many have
bought clothes to escape the guideless regiment, prancing around looking for| these
victories? Was it fear of her that brought on the world's great hurricane?
Was it fear of the desperate fire that took your best friend, too saddened to sing?|
Was it the dawning of your world and dual forms that boiled down to immortality?
