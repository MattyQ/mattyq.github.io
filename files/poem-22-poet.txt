Poem: "|Poet"

Rebirth like the soul's fat below the muscles, the tireless artist
drinks down the strands again like a| great dry cider. The aroma
of memorial crypts will never travel far in his stale breath.
I tested the cure. I saw the black contraption's screen.|
I sprung off, rolled, fell, and got caught up, and got cut,
every nerve extending my summits.| I fashioned a rutted stile
and the levers to chisel dark flowers from the waste.
