Poem: "|Til We Laugh Like This Again"

As you love me I find the past is her. Chords of memory
and breath tick with the panicked yearning.| I fell
for a day bathed in light loose and bright as fire.|

She fell in love with words. Vibrant and beautiful
that the soul would listen. They rang triumphantly
from her laced voice in such a way that I nearly toppled,|

fell for her, as sure as water flows from rock. She fell| in me,
and we fell together. The sky, shadows of the sun and moon
as leaves scattered before the wind|'s sacred touch.
