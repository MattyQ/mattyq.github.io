Poem: "|A Hundred Gallants"

The enlightened forsake the numbers and the runes,
for the land of pleasure profound.| And, honestly,
no lines for the launching of a rocket.
The whole world stretches through my dark music.
The grandeur of this sought-after land.
My cadences!| I stop a song and tops turn!

A thousand blades in a congregation line up,
gathered to find me from sun up to sun down.|
Cups scattered on the floor cry with each period
of rhythm. That is my song.| In dance robes
approach swinging happy souls, big doors open
and boots turn in the long hall, time out of time.
