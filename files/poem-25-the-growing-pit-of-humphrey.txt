Poem: "|The Growing Pit of Humphrey"

Until an addition like this one sprang up, the people of this town
pointed and counted, whispered ironical uncertain noose ties incorporated
upon the shoulder bobbins they attempted to bend and unshackle
obsessively. I remember that language. The home and garden of a rural
town as a home tucked| inside itself, slowly sinking, engulfed.
Your gaze lashes fast and light, and chaos at the wall that sits in
between me and the spikes and rock to its right|â€”you made room for my body.
