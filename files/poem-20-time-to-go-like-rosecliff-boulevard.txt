Poem: "|Time to Go Like Rosecliff Boulevard"

The door to the trash burnt the| carpet bright as rose.|

An old lady called Ellen sat at the front door of a decaying cottage.
Her granddaughter never forgot her. She sat her head on the side
of the porch way. Now,| there was a screaming from the street.
She leaned back. It was her grandfather. All gone like white clouds
turned in the white mist of green fields. Her grandfather was| so hungry
and hurt. He walked out of her home looking for a ship. He said
he tried right uptown, but he said he didn't want to go to New York|.

His stairway went up the stairs, and the cities come from the buildings.
His neighbors were hungry and gray. But her grandfather never saw the gray.
He just| went up the road to New York. New York is always strange to them.
